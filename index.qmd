# About this {-}

This is a book on using Quarto for writing and document preparation, aimed for scientists. It was initially developed as a 3 hour workshop, ["Rmarkdown for scientists"](https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/). This focusses on Quarto, which is a next-generation rmarkdown. It is now developed into a resource that will grow and change over time as a **living book**.

This book aims to teach the following:

- Getting started with your own Quarto document
  - Using Rstudio
  - Visual Studio Code
- Improve workflow:
  - RStudio
    - Demonstrate rstudio projects
    - Using keyboard shortcuts
  - Quarto projects
- Export your Quarto documents to PDF, HTML, and Microsoft Word
- Better manage figures and tables
    - Reference figures and tables in text so that they dynamically update
    - Create captions for figures and tables
    - Change the size and type of figures
    - Save the figures to disk when rendering a document
- Work with equations
    - Inline and display
    - Caption equations
    - Reference equations
- Manage bibliographies
  - Cite articles in text
  - Generate bibliographies
  - Change bibliography styles
- Debug and handle common errors with Quarto
- Next steps in working with Quarto:
  - How to extend yourself to other formats, such as slides, websites, books, and more

## Why write this as a book?

This book started out its first life being around rmarkdown. There are many great books on R Markdown and it's various features, such as ["Rmarkdown: The definitive guide"](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/), ["bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown"](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), and ["Dynamic Documents with R and knitr, Second edition"](https://www.crcpress.com/Dynamic-Documents-with-R-and-knitr/Xie/p/book/9781498716963), and Yihui Xie's thesis, ["Dynamic Graphics and Reporting for Statistics"](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/13518/).

With the [release of Quarto](https://posit.co/blog/announcing-quarto-a-new-scientific-and-technical-publishing-system/), I wanted to translate the materials I developed in "Rmarkdown for scientists" to cover the same material. Here are some resources that I really liked for learning Quarto:

- [The Quarto "get started" guide](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)
- [The Quarto guide "Quarto manuscripts"](https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/)
- [The Quarto chapter in "R for data science"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto)
- [Making shareable documents with Quarto from](https://openscapes.github.io/quarto-website-tutorial/), from OpenScapes
- [Alison Hill's blog post: "we don't talk about Quarto"](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/)
- [Mine Çentinkaya-Rundel's talk "Quarto for academics"](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2023-05-22-quarto-for-academics/)

While the Quarto guide is extensive, and indeed their "Quarto manuscripts" guide covers a lot of the ground in this book. 

> So, why write a book?

Good question. The answer is that writing this as a book provides a nice way to structure the content in the form of a workshop, in a way suitable for learning in a few hours. It is not to say that there aren't already great resources out there; there are. It is instead adding to the list of other useful information out there on the internet. I considered the Rmarkdown for Scientsts book and course a success, and it helped myself and others understand and better use rmarkdown. So I guess, to answer a question with another question:

> Why NOT write this as a book?

## How to use this book

This book was written to provide course materials for a 3 hour course on Quarto

We worked through the following sections in the book in 3 hours:

- [why use Quarto](why-qmd)
- [installation](installation)
- [what is RStudio?](rstudio)
- [suggested workflow and hygiene](workflow)
- [how to use Quarto](using-qmd)
- [using Quarto with pdf, html, and Word](pdf-html-word)
- [what are some useful keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts)
- [adding captions to tables and figures](figures-tables-captions)
- [changing figures](changing-figures)
- [adding mathematics](math)
- [citing figures and tables](cite-fig-tab-sec)
- [changing citations and styles](citations-and-styles)

With the remaining sections being used as extra material, or have since been written after the course:

- [fixing some common problems in Quarto](common-problems)
- [what are some alternative outputs of Quarto?](alternative-outputs-and-exts)
- [where to go next?](next-steps)
- [suggested references](references)

Course materials can be downloaded by using the following command from the `usethis` package:

```{r}
#| label: use-course
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
usethis::use_course("njtierney/qmd4sci-materials")
```
